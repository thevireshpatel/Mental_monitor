Project Objective
The objective of mental_monitor is to deliver a modular, reproducible journaling platform that analyzes the emotional tone of user entries, detects anomalies, and issues configurable alerts. This project aims to provide:

A clean, extensible ASP.NET Core Web API

Seamless integration with a Python-based emotion inference model

Config-driven thresholds for alerts and anomaly detection

A foundation for both programmatic and static HTML/CSS client interfaces

By the end of development, you will have a fully functional backend, comprehensive test suite, and a minimal front-end showcasing real-time emotion analytics.

Key Features
Emotion analysis powered by a Python ML model

Anomaly detection for unusual emotional patterns

Configurable alert thresholds and notification logic

RESTful endpoints for journaling, emotion inference, and alerts

Self-documenting, folder-based project structure

Optional static HTML/CSS UI for demonstration

Technology Stack
ASP.NET Core Web API

Entity Framework Core with SQL Server

Python 3.8+ for emotion inference and anomaly scripts

JavaScript, HTML, and CSS for front-end prototype

Git for version control and modular scaffolding

Getting Started
